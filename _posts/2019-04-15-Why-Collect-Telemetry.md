excerpt: "Why does the Office 365 Fiddler Extension collect telemetry?"
---

An easy question to answer. We simply need to know how prolific the extension is. It is extremely important to know the usage of the extenion to justify the work put into it and continue development. Think of this as funding a project without actually paying any money, seeing or clicking any ads or anything else. Telemetry keeps this project going, keeps stakeholders informed of the quantity of usage and justifies continual development.

Without telemetry we would largely be in the dark on the impact the development and distribution of the extension is making out in the world.
