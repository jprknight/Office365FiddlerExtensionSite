We would like greater impact with the Fiddler Extension. With this in mind the next release of the 'Exchange Online Fiddler Extension' will become the 'Office 365 Fiddler Extension'. 

You will still be able to troubleshoot Exchange Online issues the same as before. From a design perspective we are expanding our scope to include any and all Office 365 client applications. This should mean a better overall experience and a more useful tool for troubleshooting!
